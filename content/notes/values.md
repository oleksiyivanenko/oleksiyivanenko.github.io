I really like Apenwarp's idea that values is what matters and they should be
in a form of tradeoffs.

1. People over processes (help)
2. Don't shy away from responsibility (own)
   Deliver things that were promissed over taking on new things
3. Defining direction has a higher priority than getting things done (direct) // ? is it a good one?
4. Learning new things over sticking to the stuff I alredy know (learn)

Lead by showing an example over telling what to do
Mentor by asking questions over reading lectures
Influence by writing over talking


## My current thing (aspirations/goals/principles)

## Inspirations:

1. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
// One of the principles from the agile manifesto

2. Agile manifesto values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

3. The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

3. Apenwarr's [quote](https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201909)
A real value is something like "tell the truth, even when it hurts."
Or "deliver the software on schedule, even if there are bugs." In both cases,
one can legitimately imagine valuing the opposite.

## Random thoughts:

- Work on what's interesting - that sparks way better results
- Try to be around people who are passionate about what they do - it's
contagious :)
- I like creative ads and arty things despite not being a creative person at all.
