# On OKRs

I'm a big fan of the idea that direction matters a lot. In that context uniting
people around a common goal is what regularly tickles my mind.

But how do you set that goal?

**OKRs** is the default answer!

## The theory

- Measurable
- Low overhead
- Quarterly timeline
- Allowing for freedom of execution

## In practice

Let's set some goals for us, how long should it take? We all know about the
amazing OKRs framework that make it look easy and lightweight.

2 weaks later - ugh.. it seems now we have a decent draft of 2 objectives with
2 KRs each.

It's a long time since I watched
[OKRs video by Rick Klau](https://youtu.be/mJB83EZtAjc?si=Pb5JV9PJ5Lg0czTO)

After that I saw various teams working on defining and reporting their OKRs.
And it funny how disfunctional it always is.

Disfunctions of the OKRs:

1. **KR70** â€“ we didn't know how to communicate that it's ok to be ambitious
with your KRs and score them 70% at the end of the quarter.
2. Let's provide more context and tasks breakdown.
3. Let's hash out wording of the KR, as people are afraid that they commit to
something infeasible and then anticipate that they will be held accountable.

## The promises of OKRs

* Lightweight
* Hierarchical
* Timeline is long enough to give you a little of strategic perspective -
typically a quarter
* Definitions are broad enough without mentioning "how", so that it allows
for creativity and change of particular plans.

## On practice

> Let us define these 10 extra fields on each KR, so that we're absolutely sure
> we understand each other and thought through everything upfront.

Incentives of OKRs

- People persive that OKRs phrasing is connected to how they're evaluated and
by extension how they're compensated

- The only OKRs that can be motivating are those that written by a person
themself

- Respect from other people is also kind of a incentive currency

- OKRs provide visibility of your work. especially in a big org. Tha insentivise
making your okrs look complex, so that people think it was hard to achieve

- I don't want to commit to anything unfeasible

- Manager is like "I want to understand if we're in there are any problems
as soon as possible".
